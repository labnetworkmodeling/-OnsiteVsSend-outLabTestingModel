# OnsiteVsSend-outLabTestingModel

The code in this repository was used to model the decision to use onsite or sendout laboratory diagnostic services for the paper, "A generalizable decision-making framework for selecting onsite versus send-out clinical laboratory testing" currently under press in Medical Decision Making. 

An online R Shiny App (https://labnetworkmodeling.shinyapps.io/OnsiteVsSend-outLabTestingModel/) has also been created to help visualize the results of the generalizable model.
